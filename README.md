ArduinoAquariumController
=========================
I'm working on getting the sensors individually working, then gonna combine them altogether.
Using a Mega board and Uno for development. Comments will show future plans. a at end of filename is for alpha gonna add all sensors then bring it to 1_0b so that is working code. Now its just organizing thoughts. Do a search on Youtube for "aquarium controller Roger" Or something like that and you can see a working arduino controlled controller.
